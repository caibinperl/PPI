## Dataset

### Yeast core data 
The *S. cerevisiae* core dataset, as a widely used benchmark, is composed of 11188 PPI cases including 5594 positive cases proposed by Guo et al. (2008) and a heterogeneous set of 5594 negative cases according to different papers.
The positive cases are selected from the DIP database (Salwinski et al., 2004), where proteins shorter than 50 amino acids and sharing  40% sequence identity are removed.
The negative cases in these datasets are generated by randomly pairing the proteins without obvious evidence of interaction.
However, there are some differences between the S.cerevisiae positive sets from DeepFE-PPI and PIPR, so we use both of the S.cerevisiae datasets to train and test DeepTrio and other baseline approaches.
